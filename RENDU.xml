    <lb/><p>Sorry to <seg type="erreur">ressurect</seg> this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, <persName ref="#Skyshale033">Skyshale</persName>. 
        I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in ‘71, not ‘72. 
        <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_enfance">I was 12</seg> and I watched it a few times with my <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_famille">brother</seg>. It was 
        <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_technologie"> channel 58</seg> <note>Channel 58 est une chaîne fictive, qui sert de lien aux productions de l'auteur. C'est d'ailleurs le nom de sa chaîne Youtube.<ref target="https://www.youtube.com/c/local58tv"></ref></note>,
        whatever station that was. My <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_famille">mom</seg> would let me switch to it after the news. Let me see <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_souvenir">what I remember</seg>.

        It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a <seg type="topic" corresp='#topic_enfance'>little girl</seg> who imagined herself to be friends with pirates. 
        The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and <persName ref="#Pirate_Percy">Pirate Percy</persName> wasn't a very good pirate because he got <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_peur">scared</seg> too easily. 
        And there was <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_son">calliope music</seg> constantly playing. 
        Don't<seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_souvenir">remember</seg>the girl's name. Janice or Jade or something. Think it was <persName ref="#Janice">Janice</persName>.

        I <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_souvenir">remember</seg> the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged. 
        It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_enfance">Ed Wynn</seg>

                That's what the ship always told <persName ref="#Pirate_Percy">Percy</persName> when there was <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_peur">a spooky place</seg> he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was. 
        And the <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_technologie">camera</seg> would push in on Laughingstock's face with each pause. 
        YOU HAVE… TO GO… INSIDE. 
        With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened and closed it. Ugh. It just looked so cheap and awful.
        You guys <seg type="topic" corresp="#topic_souvenir">remember</seg> the villain? He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall, narrow teeth.</p>
