            Does anyone <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span> this <span class="topic_enfance">kid's show</span>? It was called Candle Cove and I must have been <span class="topic_enfance">6 or 7</span>.
            I never found reference to it anywhere so I think it was on a local station around
            1971 or 1972. 
            I lived in Ironton<a href="#noted2e201">[1]</a> at the time. 
            I don't <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span>which station, but I <span class="topic_souvenir">do remember</span> it was on at a weird time, like 4:00 PM.

            <br>YES! Okay I'm not crazy! I <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span> Pirate Percy. I was always kind of <span class="topic_peur">scared</span> of him. He looked like he was built from 
            <span class="topic_jouet">parts of other dolls</span>, real low-budget. His head was an <span class="topic_jouet">old porcelain baby doll</span>, 
            looked like an antique that didn't belong on the body. I don't <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span> what <span class="topic_technologie">station</span>
            this was! I don't think it was WTSF<a href="#noted2e278">[3]</a>though.

            <br>Sorry to <u>ressurect</u> this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, Skyshale. 
            I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in ‘71, not ‘72. 
            <span class="topic_enfance">I was 12</span> and I watched it a few times with my <span class="topic_famille">brother</span>. It was 
            <span class="topic_technologie"> channel 58</span> <a href="#noted2e314">[4]</a>,
            whatever station that was. My <span class="topic_famille">mom</span> would let me switch to it after the news. Let me see <span class="topic_souvenir">what I remember</span>.
            
            It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a <span class="topic_enfance">little girl</span> who imagined herself to be friends with pirates. 
            The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and Pirate Percy wasn't a very good pirate because he got <span class="topic_peur">scared</span> too easily. 
            And there was <span class="topic_son">calliope music</span> constantly playing. 
            Don't<span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span>the girl's name. Janice or Jade or something. Think it was Janice.

            <br>Thank you Jaren!!! <span class="topic_souvenir">Memories</span> 
            flooded back when you mentioned the Laughingstock and <span class="topic_technologie">channel 58</span>. 
            I <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span> the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged. 
            It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful <span class="topic_enfance">Ed Wynn</span>
            <a href="#noted2e374">[5]</a>
            <span class="topic_son">voice and laugh</span>. I especially <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span> how <span class="topic_peur">jarring</span> it was when they switched from the wooden/plastic model, to 
            <span class="topic_jouet">the foam puppet version</span> of the head that talked.

            <br>Ugh mike, I got <span class="topic_peur">a chill</span> reading that. Yes <span class="topic_souvenir">I remember</span>. 
            That's what the ship always told Percy when there was <span class="topic_peur">a spooky place</span> he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was. 
            And the <span class="topic_technologie">camera</span> would push in on Laughingstock's face with each pause. 
            YOU HAVE… TO GO… INSIDE. 
            With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened
            and closed it. Ugh. It just looked so cheap and awful.
            You guys <span class="topic_souvenir">remember</span> the villain? He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall,
            narrow teeth.

            <br>That wasn't the villain, the puppet with the mustache. 
            That was the villain's sidekick, Horace Horrible. 
            He had a monocle too, but it was on top of the mustache. I used to think that meant
            he had only one eye.<br>
            But yeah, the villain was another <span class="topic_jouet">marionette</span>. The Skin-Taker. 
            I can't believe what they let us watch back then.

            jesus h. christ, the skin taker. what kind of a <span class="topic_enfance">kids show</span> were we watching? 
            i seriously could not look at the <span class="topic_technologie">screen</span> when the skin taker showed up. 
            he just descended out of nowhere on his strings, just a dirty skeleton wearing that
            brown top hat and cape. 
            and his glass eyes that were too big for his skull. christ almighty.

            I used to have this <span class="topic_souvenir">awful memory</span>, a bad <span class="topic_sommeil">dream</span> 
            I had where the opening jingle ended, the show faded in from black, and all the characters
            were there, but 
            <span class="topic_technologie">the camera</span>
            was just cutting to each of their faces, and they were just 
            <span class="topic_son">screaming</span>, 
            and the <span class="topic_jouet">puppets and marionettes</span> were flailing <u>spastically</u>, and just all <span class="topic_son">screaming, screaming</span>. 
            The girl was just 
            <span class="topic_son">moaning and crying</span> like she had been through hours of this. 
            I woke up many times from that <span class="topic_sommeil">nightmare</span>. I used to wet the bed when I had it.
